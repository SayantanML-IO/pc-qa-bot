# Article Processing Settings
# ----------------------------
article_processing:
  # Number of recent articles to fetch per feed
  # Higher = more articles but slower processing
  articles_per_feed: 20
  
  # Characters per chunk for vector storage
  # Recommended: 500-1500 for semantic search
  chunk_size: 1000
  
  # Overlap between chunks to maintain context
  # Recommended: 10-20% of chunk_size
  chunk_overlap: 200
  
  # Total limit across all feeds to prevent overload
  # Adjust based on your needs and resources

# LLM Configuration
# -----------------
llm:
  # Provider: currently supports "groq"
  provider: "groq"

  # These are sent to the LLM for answer generation
  # Recommended: 3-7
  reranker_top_n: 5
  
  # LLM temperature (0.0-1.0)
  # Lower = more focused, deterministic
